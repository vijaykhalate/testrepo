Installation
Clone this repository and install the dependencies.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure requirements.txt includes all necessary dependencies, such as:

text
Copy code

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

bash
Copy code
├── tests/
│   ├── api_tests/      # API test cases using pytest
│   ├── ui_tests/       # UI test cases (optional)
│   └── robot_tests/    # Robot Framework test cases
├── reports/            # Generated test reports
├── .github/workflows/  # GitHub Actions for CI/CD
└── README.md           # Project documentation
tests/
api_tests/: Contains test cases written in pytest for API testing.
ui_tests/: (Optional) Folder for UI tests, if applicable.
robot_tests/: Contains Robot Framework .robot test cases.
Running Tests
Pytest Tests
API tests using pytest are located in the tests/api_tests directory. Ensure your test files follow the naming convention (e.g., test_*.py).

To run all pytest tests:

bash
Copy code
pytest tests/api_tests --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html
Robot Framework Tests
Robot Framework tests are located in tests/robot_tests. Each .robot file contains test cases organized by functionality.

To run all Robot Framework tests:

bash
Copy code
robot -d reports tests/robot_tests
GitHub Actions CI/CD
This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Upon every push or pull request to the main branch, tests are automatically executed.

The workflow configuration file (.github/workflows/ci.yml) defines the CI process. It installs dependencies, runs tests, and generates reports.

Sample Workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
yaml
Copy code
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run pytest
      run: |
        pytest tests/api_tests --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html
    - name: Run Robot Framework tests
      run: |
        robot -d reports tests/robot_tests
Reporting
Both pytest and Robot Framework generate HTML reports, located in the reports directory. After each test run, the latest results will be available there.
